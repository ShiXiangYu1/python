    Last week, our school was holding the sport meeting, I felt so excited, because I took part in the 800 meter race.

上周，我们学校举行了校运会，我感到很激动，因为我参加了800米竞跑。

When I heard the shot voice, I started to run, at first, I kept the uniform space, I planned to run quickly in the last 200 meter.

当我听到开跑声音的时候，我开始跑，刚开始，我保持匀速，我计划在最后200米快速跑。

But I felt so tired, I wanted to give up, then my desire to win made me stick to the end.

但是我感到很累，想要放弃，然后我的求胜欲望使我坚持到了最后。

I am so proud of myself.

我为自己感到自豪。
